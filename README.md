# discord.rb

![CI Pipeline](https://ci.codeberg.org/api/badges/14824/status.svg)

W.I.P. Discord API wrapper written in Ruby for fun.

The test.rb file creates two commands "test" and "test2", that return "Hi" and "Hello World!" respectively, sets the bot's current activity to 'Watching if i work', and sets the presence to online since the program was started provided you provide the required data in `env.rb.template` and rename it to `env.rb`.
